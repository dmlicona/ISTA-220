1. *What is a console app?*

* A console application is an application that runs in a Command Prompt window instead of providing a graphical user interface (GUI). 

2. *What does Main() (the main method) do in a console application?*

* The Main method designates the program’s entry point.

3. *What is the purpose of a namespace?*

* It is a collection of resources. Solves the name-clashing problem by creating a container for items such as classes.

4. *Describe specifically what using statements do.*

* A using statement is a statement that contains the "using" keyword and provides the syntax to specify the scope of the use of a resource object. It imports namespaces

5. *What is an assembly?*

* Compiled classes are an assembly. An assembly is a collection of types and resources that are built to work together and form a logical unit of functionality. It is a chunk of executable code.

6. *What is the relationship between an assembly and a namespace?*

* There is no relationship. Namespaces contain classes built to work together and form a function. Namespaces are compiled in an assembly. 

7. *What is a graphical app?*

* It is the user interface (UI) of a Windows application

8. *What is the starting point in a graphical application?*

* app.xaml 
 
9. *What does Build do?*

* Builds any assemblies which have changed files from the last build. Build transforms code into binary computer language (ones and zeros) 

10. *(Not in book) What is bytecode? What is Microsoft CIL? Do you think that CIL is bytecode? Why or why not?*

* Bytecode is program code that has been compiled from source code into low-level code designed for a software interpreter. CIL (Common Intermediate Language) is a bytecode and the language of the . NET platform into which are compiled source code written in high level languages. Its operations are based on a stack and it is executed by a virtual machine.

11. *What does Debug do?*

* Debugging is the process of finding errors during application execution. It does not mean syntax errors, with which the application cannot be compiled, but on logic errors. Runs code line by line finding errors.
